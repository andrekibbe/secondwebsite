# Second Website

This is my first attempt to make a GitHub Page without following a tutorial.
Instead of slavishly following the directions in [*Learn Enough Git to Be
Dangerous*](http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial), I'm trying to follow the sequence of the material without actually copying the content.

Once I've created a complete of web pages, created a couple of branches, merged
them, added a GitHub page branch, and published the branch to a live site, I'll
move on some projects for learning HTML and CSS in more depth using [*Head First
HTML and
CSS*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13355960-head-first-html-and-css).
